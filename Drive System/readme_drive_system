The working of rover drive system:

The drive system of rover is controlled wirelessly and consists of 6 motors controled individually. 
The motor used is planetary high torque, high rpm geared DC motor.
The main central processing unit on the rover is RaspberryPi 3B+. 
Each motor has an individual encoder which forms the feedback system of the motor and a motor driver which can control two motors at the same time.
Motor drivers are connected to an arduino mega which in turn is connected to the RaspberryPi from which it recieves instructions.
PWM pins are used to control the rpm of the motors in order to move the rover as desired.
The RaspberryPi is remotely connected to a computer at the base staton through wireless SSH.
Range of this connection is extended using a Rocket M5.
